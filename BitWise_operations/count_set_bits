def count_set_bits(number):
    count=0
    while number:
        count += number&1
        number = number >> 1
    return count


number = input()
print(count_set_bits(int(number)))



Example:
number=5 (101)

*
101 & 1 =  1  => count = 1
101 >> 1 = 10 

*
10 & 1 = 0 => count is still 1
10 >> 1 = 1

*
1 & 1 = 1 => count is 2
1 >> 1 = 0 

loop will exit as number become 0
Ans => count = 2
